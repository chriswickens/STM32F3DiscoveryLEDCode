# LED Patterns and Random ARM Assembly

This is some code I used to learn about programming the STM32F3Discovery board. The C code requires a specific code base provided by my professor, which I will not be including here.
The Assembly code was just my test bed for understanding how to use GDB and ARM Assembly in thumb mode.

It's nothing crazy, but I enjoyed learning with it and having some physical feedback from writing programs for a change!
